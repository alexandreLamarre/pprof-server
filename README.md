- [pprofreceiver](https://github.com/alexandreLamarre/otelcol-bpf/tree/main/receiver/pprofreceiver#readme), a collector that collects pprof profiles from remote endpoint
- Coming soon : [bpfstack](https://github.com/alexandreLamarre/otelcol-bpf/tree/main/receiver/bpfstack#readme) collector that collects cpu profiles using eBPF
